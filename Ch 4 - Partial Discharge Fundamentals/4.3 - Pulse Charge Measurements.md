Partial discharge transients have durations in the nanosecond range and frequency spectrum up to 100 MHz. Therefore, during the transient, the test object can be considered decoupled from the HV supply and the charge flowing through the defect results in a voltage drop across the object. The recharging current can be measured through a [[Measuring impedance]] and integrated to yield the [[Apparent Charge]]. Additionally, a [[Coupling capacitor]] is placed across the test object to provide a low-inductance recharging path.
