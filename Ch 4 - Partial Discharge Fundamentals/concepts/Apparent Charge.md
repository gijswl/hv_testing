The apparent charge is the main quantity that is measured during PD testing and is usually expressed in picocoulombs \[pC]. It is the charge that appears to flow through the test object and is not equal to the amount of charge locally involved at the site of the discharge.

It is defined by IEC 60270:2000 as "that charge which, if injected within a very short time between the terminals of the test object in a specified test circuit, would give the same reading on the measuring instrument as the PD current itself."
