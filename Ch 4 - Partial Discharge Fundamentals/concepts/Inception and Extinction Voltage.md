The inception (PDIV) and extinction (PDEV) voltage are the voltages at which the PD activity starts and stops, respectively. Generally, in case of harmful PD, the extinction voltage is lower than the inception.

Care must be taken in noisy environments, because the real inception and extinction may be masked by the noise, resulting in values of PDIV/PDEV that are too high.
