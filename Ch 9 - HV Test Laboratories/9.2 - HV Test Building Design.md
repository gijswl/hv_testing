## Grounding and shielding
Several grounding systems and return circuits must be considered during the design of a high-voltage test building: [[Building ground]], [[Test field ground]], [[Electromagnetic shielding]], [[Test circuit return]]. These systems must be connected together at only a single point to prevent the formation of ground loops.

Communication lines that are not fiber optic links must be shielded and filtered before they enter the test hall.
## Power supply
A complete HV test laboratory is usually supplied from the MV network through one or more three-phase distribution transformers. The external power supply connects to a _power supply room_, which is in close proximity to the test hall and should also be shielded!

The incoming power is filtered by high-frequency power filters, which block frequency components higher than 50/60 Hz. If the power supply room is not shielded, the HF filters must be attached between the regulators and test generators.
