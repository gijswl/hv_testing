A conductive contact of the test field ground with the [[Building ground]] and upper layers of the soil should be avoided, because return currents from power electronic-drive machines and equipment from the factory flow there. 
The test field must be grounded into deeper layers of the soil and electrically insulated from the upper layers and the building ground.
