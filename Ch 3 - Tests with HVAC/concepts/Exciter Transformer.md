The exciter transformer delivers an exciting voltage to a resonant circuit. The output voltage of the exciter depends on the quality factor of the test system and the required test voltage.

The exciter is designed to deliver an active feeding power $P_F$, which limits the maximum test capacitive test power $S_T$.
$$S_T = Q P_F$$
If the exciter were operated at half the nominal voltage, only a quarter of the feeding power would be available, limiting the capacitive load. Therefore, exciter transformers typically have multiple taps at fractions of the nominal output voltage to ensure sufficient power can be delivered over the full voltage range.
