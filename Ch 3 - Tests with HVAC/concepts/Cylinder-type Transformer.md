In a cylinder-type transformer, the active part is placed inside an insulating cylinder, and the high-voltage insulation is partly achieved by the height of the cylinder.
No bushing is required since the ground and high-voltage electrodes are physically separated.

This construction limits the cooling performance and, therefore, the test power and/or duration.
### Construction
Two design concepts are possible for the active part:
1. Coaxial structure: The low-voltage winding is placed on the core, and the high-voltage winding is wound around it concentrically. The core should be grounded in this case.
2. Divided structure: The low- and high-voltage windings are wound concentrically on the two legs of the core. The lower winding carries LV up to the HV half potential. The core is connected to this "half" potential. The oil gap between the windings has to withstand the full output voltage.
