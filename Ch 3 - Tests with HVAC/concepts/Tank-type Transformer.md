In a tank-type transformer, the active part is arranged inside a metal tank which is filled with oil and possibly equipped with radiators. A bushing is required to obtain the high-voltage signal from inside the grounded tank (either oil-to-air or oil-to-SF<sub>6</sub>).

This type of transformer offers the best cooling and gives the highest test current/power. It does not require any clearance to neighbouring walls or equipment, resulting in a compact arrangement.
In addition, they are well-suited for outdoor operation and can be placed outside the laboratory.
