High AC test voltages can be generated in a number of ways: AC test transformers, transformer cascades, and resonant circuits.
## AC test transformers (ACT)
High AC voltages can be generated using a transformer with a high step-up ratio, called an [[AC Transformer]]. A test system based on an ACT is shown below. The output voltage is measured, based on which the regulator is adjusted to control the output voltage.
Depending on the required output voltage, several test transformers can be placed in a [[Test Transformer Cascades|cascade]].

The short-circuit current of such a system depends on the [[Impedance Voltage]] of the feeding transformer (subscript $F$), regulator (subscript $R$), and test transformer (subscript $T$):
$$v_{k} = v_{kT} + \frac{S_R}{S_T} v_{kR} + \frac{S_F}{S_T} v_{kF} \implies I_k = \frac{I_m}{v_k}$$
Test transformers and the other components are not always short-circuit resistant. In this case, an additional impedance must be placed in series with the test object to limit the short-circuit current.
## Resonant circuits (ACR)
If an inductance (called [[Reactor]]) is placed in series with the load, so as to completely compensate the capacitive reactance of the load, a series resonant circuit is obtained. Two types of circuits can be made: [[Reactor#Reactors for inductance-tuned resonance|inductance-tuned]] and [[Reactor#Reactors for frequency-tuned resonance|frequency-tuned]].
This resonant circuit is driven by a relatively low-voltage [[Exciter Transformer]], which has to supply only the resistive losses. The high test voltage $V_T$ developed across the reactor is much higher than the feeding voltage $V_F$.
$$V_T = Q V_F$$
where $Q = \frac{S_C}{P_R}$ is the quality factor of the test system.
$$Q = \left[ \frac{1}{Q_F} + \frac{1}{Q_T} \right]$$
Resonant test systems are typically supplied with a _basic load capacitor_ greater than $C_{min}$ with which the system can be operated. This capacitor can be part of the HV divider, coupling capacitor, or an HV filter.

Cylinder-type reactors can be stacked and connected in series to reach higher testing voltages (note that this also increases the test power). Higher test currents can be obtained by placing reactors in parallel.
