High AC test voltages can be generated in a number of ways: AC test transformers, transformer cascades, and resonant circuits.
## AC test transformers (ACT)
High AC voltages can be generated using a transformer with a high step-up ratio, called an [[AC Transformer]]. A test system based on an ACT is shown below. The output voltage is measured, based on which the regulator is adjusted to control the output voltage.
Depending on the required output voltage, several test transformers can be placed in a [[Test Transformer Cascades|cascade]].

The short-circuit current of such a system depends on the [[Impedance Voltage]] of the feeding transformer (subscript $F$), regulator (subscript $R$), and test transformer (subscript $T$):
$$v_{k} = v_{kT} + \frac{S_R}{S_T} v_{kR} + \frac{S_F}{S_T} v_{kF} \implies I_k = \frac{I_m}{v_k}$$
Test transformers and the other components are not always short-circuit resistant. In this case, an additional impedance must be placed in series with the test object to limit the short-circuit current.
